l2 - 20/20 - No comment
l3a - 7.5/10 - Your procedure for part b is very good. My only concern is if this is realistic given the 2 hrs you have as it takes quite a while for things to reach steady state and thus repeating for each fan setting might take too long, otherwise there is no issues with the procedure.
l3b - 14.5/20 - * Use a title page * Methods are usually better described step by step. You methods also include some things that should be in the analysis such as the discussion about steady state and the balance of the energy equation. * Why do you have so many values of h? This is confusing. * You results section could be better structured. * I think you did a good job with the analysis, especially in the error section. Note that you can include values in your analysis instead of always referring the reader to another section to improve readability. * Some section of the report read slightly informal, you could work on this for future reports. * Overall good work, see notes on the document itself.
l5a - 9/10 - the way the results are presented could be improved. there is no objective, conclusion, etc.
l5b - 18/20 - It is necessary to re-read your writing before submission to avoid spelling and grammar errors. Objectives of the experiments should be in the introduction section. tables and plots are not presented professionally, e.g. Legends are not mentioning the axial or circ. strains clearly. Theoretical equations need to be discussed more. Theoretical value for the pressure is not calculated. The effect of the temperature on the metal can expansion should be discussed.
