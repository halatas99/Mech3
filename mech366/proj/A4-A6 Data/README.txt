Test 2 was our initial testing on November 15th. The fan was off for most of the testing until the very end. 

Test 3 was on November 22nd. The fan was on at 5V the entire time. We gave the heater multiple step inputs (see Test 3 notes)

Test 4 was also on November 22nd. For the first part of this test, we kept the heater voltage constant and varied the fan voltage. For the second part of this test, we varied both the heater and fan voltage at the same time. (See Test 3 notes as well - I didn't make a new note file)
